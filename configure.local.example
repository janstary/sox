# For all settings documented in this file, there are reasonable

# Consequently, you only need to create a file ./configure.local
# and put any of these settings into it if ./configure autodetection
# fails or if you want to make different choices for other reasons.

# If autodetection fails, please tell <hans@stare.cz>

# We recommend that you write ./configure.local from scratch and
# only put the lines there you need.  This file contains examples.
# It is not intended as a template to be copied as a whole.

# --- user settings relevant for all builds ----------------------------

PREFIX="/usr/local"
BINDIR="${PREFIX}/bin"
LIBDIR="${PREFIX}/lib"
INCDIR="${PREFIX}/include"
MANDIR="${PREFIX}/man"

CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -I/usr/local/include"
LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -L/usr/local/lib"
#LDFLAGS="-Wl,-z,relro"

# It is possible to change the utility program used for installation
# and the modes files are installed with.  The defaults are:

INSTALL="install"
INSTALL_PROGRAM="${INSTALL} -m 0555"
INSTALL_LIB="${INSTALL} -m 0444"
INSTALL_MAN="${INSTALL} -m 0444"
INSTALL_DATA="${INSTALL} -m 0444"

# --- user settings for the mandoc(3) library --------------------------

# By default, libmandoc.a is not installed.  It is almost never needed
# because there is almost no non-mandoc software out there using this
# library.  The one notable exception is NetBSD apropos(1).
# So, when building for the NetBSD base system - but not for NetBSD
# ports nor for pkgsrc! - you may want the following:

INSTALL_LIBMANDOC=1

# The following settings are only used when INSTALL_LIBMANDOC is set.

#INCLUDEDIR="${PREFIX}/include/mandoc"
#LIBDIR="${PREFIX}/lib/mandoc"

# In rare cases, it may be required to skip individual automatic tests.
# Each of the following variables can be set to 0 (test will not be run
# and will be regarded as failed) or 1 (test will not be run and will
# be regarded as successful).
