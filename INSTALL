                           SoX Installation
                           ----------------

SoX should compile and run on any POSIX compatible system.
For other compilers/systems, it is often possible to manually
construct a custom `soxconfig.h' and `Makefile' for that system
(the minimum requirements are 32-bit CPU, 64-bit FPU, C89 compiler).

Note that the `play', `rec', and `soxi' programs are in fact just
copies-of or links-to (depending on OS) `sox'.

SoX optionally makes use of some external libraries to obtain support
for additional file formats and/or effects.  Optional libraries should
be installed before compiling SoX.  The current list of supported
libraries, where to get them (if not from your OS distribution), and
their licence types, is as follows:

Compiling and installing on a POSIX system
------------------------------------------

First install any optional libraries that you need for SoX.  Some
libraries may require pkg-config to be installed to be properly
detected by SoX.

[Only if you're compiling the git sources, first make sure you have
the GNU autotools installed (automake >= 1.9, autoconf >= 2.62) and
run

	autoreconf -i
]

To compile and install SoX (executables, libraries, manual pages) with
a default configuration for your platform, run the following commands:

	./configure
	make -s
	make install

There should be no errors and few, if any, warnings during the `make
-s' stage.  Any warnings about pointer mismatch or conversion should
be treated with deep suspicion.

The `make install' command may require `root' priviliges; for example,
on some systems, the following modification to the command is needed:

	sudo make install

To run a selection of tests on the installed sox executable:

	make installcheck

Optionally, HTML & PDF versions of the manual pages can be built and
installed as follows:

	make html
	make install-html
	make pdf
	make install-pdf

Again, `root' priviliges may be needed at the install stages.



Custom build options on a POSIX system
--------------------------------------

Selection of optional libraries and of other build options can be made
by adding parameters to the `./configure' command line (above).  Run

	./configure --help

for a complete list of options.

Each optional file-format may be configured to be loaded statically
(the default) or dynamically.  The dynamic option may be useful for
distribution packaging reasons -- for example, to keep separate `free'
and `non-free' software.

If you are building SoX for a `distribution' (i.e. the build will be
used by others), please use --with-distro to identify the distribution
as this information is useful in helping to diagnose SoX bug reports.
For example,

	./configure --with-distro='Super Linux OS 6.1'

If any libraries are installed in a non-standard locations in your
system then you can use the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables to allow
configure to find them. For example:

./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/home/sox/include -I/usr/local/multimedia/include" LDFLAGS="-L/home/sox/lib -L/usr/local/multimedia/lib"

Newer versions of SoX include support for loading libraries for
file formats at runtime.  The main usage of this feature is to
allow shipping SoX without dependencies on external libraries
that are not globally used or have redistribution restrictions.
If you experience problems with this then you may wish to disable
this feature:

./configure --without-libltdl

Also, the default behavior even when libltdl is used is to link
all file format handlers into libsox as there is a performance
hit when dynamically loading external libraries.  To force a format
handler to be built as a dynamically loaded module, pass "dyn" to
its --with-* option.  For example, to build pulseaudio handler as
an external dynamic library:

./configure --with-pulseaudio=dyn

A subset of external libraries can be configured to be dlopen()'ed
at run time instead of being linked in.  This will allow one to
distribute a binary with optional features that only require
a user to install the missing libraries into their system.  This
can be enabled using:

--enable-dl-lame
--enable-dl-mad
--enable-dl-sndfile
--enable-dl-amrnb
--enable-dl-amrwb

Testing
-------

N.B.: If SoX is configured and compiled to load some file-formats
dynamically, then it will not be able to load them when running SoX
executables from within the source file directory until after SoX has
been installed (temporarily configuring with --without-libltdl removes
this restriction).

After successfully compiling SoX, try translating a sound file.  You
should also playback the new file to make sure it sounds like the
original.  You can either use an external program or SoX itself
if compiled with playback support.

To work with widest range of playback programs, you should chose a
format that is native to your OS, such as WAV or AIFF. In the following
example, we'll use .xxx as the extension of your preferred format.

        cd src
	./sox monkey.wav monkey.xxx

You may have to give the word size and rate for the file. For example,
this command will make a sound file with a data rate of 12,500 samples
per second and the data formatted as 2-byte (16-bit) signed integers:

	./sox monkey.wav -r 12500 -2 -s monkey.xxx

If playback support was compiled in then it can be played like this:

        ./play monkey.xxx

or, equivalently:

        ./sox monkey.xxx -d

If monkey.xxx plays properly (it's a very short monkey screech),
congratulations! SoX works.

If you're adding new features to SoX or want to perform advance tests
on a new platform then you can use the scripts "tests.sh" and
"testall.sh" to stress SoX.
